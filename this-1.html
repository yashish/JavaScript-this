	//So it now works as expected
	psychic.askQuestion(debunker.debunk);

	/* Thing is, when the callback is passed as a function reference using debunker.debunk and not executed as debunker.debunk(), then the debunk function has no owner when it was called. If it has no owner, it automatically attaches itself to the parent object - which is DOMWindow!

	All in all, the scope of "this" can be very confusing and change depending on how a function is called.
	We can mitigate this by following a pattern of enclosing "this" inside a closure within the function to the intended object.
	See this-2.html for the resolution and accepted practice.
