	/* Even though it works above, unlike C# or Java, "this" works differently in JavaScript.
	   In C# or Java "this" would ALWAYS refer to the enclosing class instance. 

	   Not so in JavaScript. In the expression psychic.answerQuestion();
	   "this" is scoped to the function owner, here the psychic object. If using an object literal, then "this" is scoped to the left of the dot.

	   Unfortunately this rule does not always hold! "this" gets scoped on HOW your function is called. More on this in this-1.html
